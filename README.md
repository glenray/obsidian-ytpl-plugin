## Fetch YouTube Playlist

This command prompts the user for a url to a YouTube playlist. A video note is created for each video. A playlist note is also created which lists all of the related videos. The video notes and the playlist notes are all saved in a separate directory making it easy to stay organized. 

A Youtube api key is required.

- Create a new project or select an existing one
- Enable the YouTube Data API v3
- Go to Credentials and create an API key
- Copy the API key and paste it in the settings pane.
